-timestamp_first active --- do most people do some research before actually committing to booking airbnb? or do they do things in quick succession?
-gender --- which sex is more inclined to travel? if difference at all. Maybe speaks to disparity between pay or maybe just natural wanderlust.
-age --- different buckets of age of travel?
-signup flow --- maybe if they're coming from a travel website right before booking they've already exhausted other choices? or maybe google is king.
-language --- international language preference - maybe likely that what they speak is their preference. "returning to roots" maybe.
-affiliate_channel --- paid marketing what is this?
-affiliate_provider --- does it matter if it's not from airbnb?
-first_affiliate_tracked --- what is the source of media that is the best at gaining customers? if there is a best at all.
-country_destination: THIS IS Y VARIABLE

-sessions --- average web sessions until booking?
-action
-action_type
-action_detail
-device_type --- mobile vs desktop? maybe mobile - just browsing, desktop - commit? or maybe it's different per age group?
-secs_elapsed --- maybe how long they spend on airbnb is biggest indicator of whether they buy or not? (maybe it takes 5 minutes to go through and pay for it)
